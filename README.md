# finiam.com

Finiam's website. Made with Gatsby.

## Scripts

- `bin/server` to run in development mode.
- `bin/build` to output the website to a `public` folder. Ideal for production environments.

## Notables

Never update `gatsby-remark-relative-images`. Their `0.3.0` version will BREAK every single image on the blog right now so please avoid.
